# HTML-CSS Projects

This repository has been created to store my various web projects using **HTML**, **CSS**. The files here contain my personal projects, experiments, and different works related to web design and development. Each project is independent and may **not be mobile-friendly** or **not use CSS**, as my goal is to test and learn different design approaches.

## Content

This repository contains various projects I've done with **HTML**, **CSS**. Projects include:

- Basic webpage designs
- HTML and CSS experiments
- Layouts and designs created using CSS
- Various styles and color palettes used in web design

## Usage

- You can review this repository to check out different web design examples.
- You may copy or adapt the files for use in your own projects.
- My projects are mostly for learning purposes, so each project may be incomplete or only focus on a specific feature.

## Future Plans

- I plan to add new projects focused on different web design concepts.
- I will include more professional projects using **CSS frameworks**.
- I aim to continually update my projects and explore new techniques and design approaches.
